# Introduction


Path.'s Universal API platform offers a consistent view of data across the crypto ecosystem. The API provides methods for retrieving data from exchanges, wallets and various data sources. Data sources are extracted with read-only mode. No write updates are performed to ensure the integrity and security of all data sources.

The base URL for all API requests is <code>https://api.path.tech</code>


<aside class="notice">We NEVER request exchange login credentials or passwords. We do not store any exchange's API secret keys.</aside>

<aside class="warning">These APIs are at ALPHA stage. It is being used in early integrations and testing. It is expected there will be  changes before our production release. We welcome any feedback or suggestions hello@path.one </aside>

<aside class="notice">This version of the API offers READ-only functionality.</aside>


## Authentication

> POST /token

> Example Request


```shell
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST \
	-d '{"name":"myappname", "api_key":"00000000-0..."}' https://api.path.tech/token
```


> Example Response

```json
{
	"access_token":
		{
		  {
			"name": "myappname",
			"token": "eyJ0eXA...",
			"expires": "2018-10-05T19:54:08Z"
		  }
		}
}
```


To verify incoming API requests, Path.â€™s APIs use access tokens, similar to OAuth application-only authentication.

To obtain the token, you must authenticate your account using your app's name and the app's secret API key. You can manage your API keys in the dashboard. Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth. 

Authentication to the API is performed via HTTP Basic Auth. You do not need to provide a password.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

The token has an expiration time. Once expired, you will need to re-authenticate to obtain a new token.

## Pagination

Certain bulk requests (fetching  `transactions` or `ledgers`) may return a large number of objects, so results are paginated.  

Pagination is via the `offset` parameter.  Bulk request responses contain `total`  and `offset` fields. Manipulate the `offset` parameter to fetch all available objects. Objects are returned in reverse chronological order (most recent first).

Pagination are available for API requests that support bulk fetches. It will be listed in the API's defintion.

<aside class="notice">Once the <code>total</code> objects are known, it is advisable to use <code>GET</code> to fetch the remaining objects. This will fetch from the cache and avoid re-fetching from the data source.</aside>

Name |  | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
limit | optional | A limit on the number of objects to be returned, between 1 and 500. (Default 500.)
offset | optional | The number of objects to skip from the first (most recent) record. (Default 0.)



## Webhooks

Many data sources (especially exchanges) have preset rate limits on how much or how often data may be retrieved. To minimize the impact of potentially hitting these limits, we intelligently allocate resources for data-intensive APIs and offer a call back parameter to inform the requesting client once the data is ready.

The parameter <code>callback_url</code> containing the destination URL to post the response data may be provided as part of the API request. The post back to the <code>callback_url</code> is 'as is' with no additional processing. So you may pass in additional application related parameters.

For example <code>callback_url: https://myapp.com/dosomething?myparam=xyz</code>

When processing the response, use [pagination](#pagination) to fetch any remaining objects.

Support for webhook callbacks will be listed in the API's definition.

## Sandbox

API requests in the sandbox may be slower than production endpoints. To help us debug and iterate, there are minimal caching and extensive debug logs in the sandbox environment.  Data may also be purged on a regular basis.  We maintain the same strong security measure for this environment. 

The base URL for all sandbox API requests is <code>https://sandbox.path.tech/</code>

## Transaction type

There are currently no standard (or consistent use) of transaction types across the different exchanges. Path. will intelligently map these (based on context) to one of the following:

Name | Description
--------- | -----------
bought | A transaction that is a buy trade.
sold | A transaction that is a sell trade.
received | The asset was received from a destination (source of ownership unknown). 
send | The asset was transferred to another destination (source of ownership unknown).
transfer | The asset was transferred to another destination owned by the same user.


# Source

<code>Source</code> objects in Path. represent the data source to extract information. These are exchanges and wallets.

<aside class="notice">Any data source keys (for example: api secret) provided are never stored in our system and it is used only during the duration of the request.</aside> 

<aside class="notice">A general rule of thumb: 
	POST requests are typically a fetch from the remote data source. GET requests return cache data from prior fetches. </aside>

## List Sources

> GET /sources

> Example Request

```shell
$ curl  -H "Authorization: mytoken"  https://api.path.tech/sources
```
> Example Response

```json
{
	"data":[
		{
			"label": "Coinbase Pro",
			"name": "coinbase_pro",
			"type": "exchange",
			"key": true,
			"oauth": false,
			"csv": false,
			"address": false
		}
		{...},
		{...}
	]	
}
```

List all currently supported data sources where Path. may extract data information. 

No authentication required for this public API.


### Source Object

Name | Description
--------- | -----------
label | The readable name of the data source.
name | The name of the data source. This is the name used to make API requests.
type | The type of data source.
key | If true, data source's API key/secret is supported for retrieving data.
oauth | If true, supports oauth token for authentication.
csv | If true, support CSV file upload and processing of data
address | If true, support fetching transactions with just the wallet address.



# User

Path. does not store any data source login credentials or exchange's API keys. So the <code>User</code> object associate data sources to a specific anonymous user. A <code>User</code> is essentially the owner of the data from the different data sources (exchanges, wallets etc) with no specific user identifying information.  All requests for transaction or ledger data will always be associated with a <code>User</code>.  

For example, you may want to fetch data for the same user from Coinbase and Binance.  For your app, you will associate your app's user with the same <code>User</code> object id. 


Data for a <code>User</code> are stored in our system for computational purposes. You may delete it at any time. One advantage of it being in our system is that we can minimize requests to external sources (for example, throttles on exchanges). It will also provide a faster response to requests, as there is minimal recalculation.

For remote data source requests (for example, exchanges), the speed of the response is very much dependent on the data source. Typically, a GET request is more efficient than a POST request (that will fetch from a remote target).


## Exchange Call Limits

Many exchanges set a limit on the number of requests made within a certain timeframe. 

Where possible, our system will only fetch new data that was not previously recorded.  This ensures we minimize any impact of the call limits that may exist on the data source.

# Known Issues

CSV and Bitfinex support are currently experimental.

Please check our [blog post](https://blog.path.one/known-issues-and-challenges-with-exchanges-api/) for other current known issues.

# Roadmap

- Additional data sources


[Path. Tax](https://path.one/tax)  is our reference application built on top of the Path. API platform. The architecture decouples the business logic from the data layer. Information like gain and loss are not offered as part of the base API platform. If you are interested in learning more please contact us directly at hello@path.one
